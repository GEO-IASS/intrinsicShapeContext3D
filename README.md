intrinsicShapeContext3D
=======================

This is an implementation of the work presented by Kokkinos et. al (Intrinsic Shape Context Descriptors for Deformable Shapes).
The idea of this demo is using the intrinsic shape context with the Heat Kernel Signature as field function to classify read
models in one of 3 class: bear, human and ant.
